Aotools
=========

Useful tools for Adaptive Optics analysis for the Python Programming Language


Required libraries
------------------

```python
SciPy
NumPy
```


Installation
------------

As everything is just pure python, you don't really need to "install" at all. To be able to use the tools from anywhere on your system, add the `aotools` directory to your `PYTHONTPATH`. Alternatively, to install the tools to your system python distribution, run:

    python setup.py install

(which may need admin or root privileges) from the `aotools` directory.
